## What is This?

Here in New Zealand our Ministry of Health (MoH) compiles a list of cases and some information about them on this page: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases.

While the number of case (as of 23/03/2020) is relatively low, it can be hard to see a summary or filter for cases in your area, by sex or age group. This simple Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script fixes that.

## How to Install

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) addon on your browser of choice
2. Click [this URL to install the script](https://github.com/finnito/nz-covid-19-cases-table-filter/raw/master/covid-19-moh-filter.user.js)
3. Refresh the Ministry of Health web page
